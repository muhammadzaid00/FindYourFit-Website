        <h4>Introduction:</h4>

    <p id="benefits">Manual therapy has a long history within the profession of physical therapy and physical
    therapists have greatly contributed to the current diversity in manual therapy approaches and
    techniques. Although initially mechanical explanations were favored to explain the mechanisms
    by which manual therapy interventions were thought to work, there is increasing research
    evidence for intricate neurophysiologic mechanisms and we should also not overlook the 
    beneficial psychological effects of providing hands-on examination and intervention.
    <br> <br>
    Manual therapy diagnosis still uses a variety of diagnostic classification models with mechanism and
    increasingly, treatment-based classification models favored within the physical therapy 
    profession. Research evidence abounds for the effectiveness of manual therapy interventions
    for a wide variety of neuromusculoskeletal diagnoses and clinical prediction rules and other 
    research intended to establish relevant treatment-based subgroups hold great promise for 
    expanding this evidence base. Even within the domain of physical therapy, risk of harm with 
    manual therapy interventions is certainly present but a common sense approach to patient and 
    technique selection combined with proven adequate orthopedic diagnostic skills223 seems 
    appropriate for minimizing manual therapy-related adverse events and optimizing the risk-benefit
    ratio with regard to the use of manual therapy interventions.
    <br> <br>

    <h4>Procedure:</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Manual therapy involves the application of force to joints, muscles and neural tissues to
    facilitate improved function. This may be achieved by increasing the range of motion of joints,
    reducing swelling or enhancing skeletal alignment. Manual therapy can be applied during and
    following the acute phase of the injury. Joints can be mobilized or manipulated to increase
    the range of motion, improve alignment, or reduce pain and swelling. Various massage techniques
    can be used including petrissage, effleurage, transverse frictions or gliding, digital ischaemic
    pressure and vacuum cupping. Massage techniques in sports injuries are used to aid drainage,
    increase localized blood flow and breakdown scar tissue.</p>
    <br>

    <p id="benefits">Here are some of the specific <span id="highlight"> benefits </span>that these 
        manual therapy techniques offer: </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h4>1. Increases blood flow:</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Moving and stimulating the area helps deliver nutrient-rich blood to the injured area to help
    the healing process. </p>
    <br>

    <h4>2. Relaxes tense muscles:</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Therapeutic massage promotes a relaxation response from muscles that are often tense and 
    spastic due to injury.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>3. Improves range of motion:</h4>
    <p id="benefits">By using gentle and precise movements to activate joints and soft tissue, a therapist 
     restore functionality and improve mobility.</p>

        <h4>Introduction:</h4>

    <p id="benefits">In the modern world, the South Asian art of yoga has expanded to all corners
    of the globe. While it is now a popular form of exercise and meditation, this has not always
    been the case. Yoga is well known for its postures and poses, but they were not a key part
    of original yoga traditions in India. Fitness was not a primary goal. Practitioners and followers
    of yogic tradition focused instead on other practices, such as expanding spiritual energy using
    breathing methods and mental focus. Male yoga practitioners are known as yogis, and female
    yoga practitioners are called yoginis. Both practiced and taught yoga long before any written
    account of yoga came into existence.

    <br> <br>
    Manual therapy diagnosis still uses a variety of diagnostic classification models with mechanism and
    increasingly, treatment-based classification models favored within the physical therapy 
    profession. Research evidence abounds for the effectiveness of manual therapy interventions
    for a wide variety of neuromusculoskeletal diagnoses and clinical prediction rules and other 
    research intended to establish relevant treatment-based subgroups hold great promise for 
    expanding this evidence base. Even within the domain of physical therapy, risk of harm with 
    manual therapy interventions is certainly present but a common sense approach to patient and 
    technique selection combined with proven adequate orthopedic diagnostic skills223 seems 
    appropriate for minimizing manual therapy-related adverse events and optimizing the risk-benefit
    ratio with regard to the use of manual therapy interventions.</p>
    <br> <br>

    <div>
        <h4>Introduction:</h4>

    <p id="benefits">The therapeutic practice of manipulating the muscles and limbs to ease
    tension and reduce pain. Massage can be a part of physical therapy or practiced on its own.
    It can be effective for reducing the symptoms of disorders of or pain in the muscles and nervous
    system, and it is often used to reduce stress.</p>
    <br> <br>

    <h4>Importance:</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Considering the long history of massage, its existence in Western medicine
        is still only in its infancy. That said, the growth and research into the healing properties
        of therapeutic massage has fast gained momentum, and public demand for massage therapy is
        at an all time high. Today, massage is seen everywhere from spas, gyms, and workplaces
        to hospitals, nursing homes, and birthing centres. It’s also used heavily in physical
        therapy and chiropractic clinics to increase circulation and expedite the healing of
        injured muscles</p>
    <br>

    <p id="benefits">While often preliminary or conflicting, there is scientific evidence that massage may help
    with pain and may improve quality of life for people with depression, cancer, and HIV/AIDS. 
    Following are the <span id="highlight"> benefits </span>of massage: </p>
    <br> <br>

    <h4>1. Reduce Pain</h4>
    <p id="benefits">A 2008 research review and 2011 NCCIH-funded clinical trial concluded that
        massage may be useful for chronic low-back pain. Similarly a 2009 clinical trial reported
        massage may help with chronic neck pain. A 2013 sytematic review of sytematic reviews found
        that there is an emerging body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of massage therapy
        for the treatment of non-specific low back pain in the short term. </p>
    <br>

    <h4>2. Depression</h4>
    <p id="benefits">A 2010 meta-analysis of 17 clinical trials concluded that massage therapy
        may help to reduce depression and a 2010 review concluded that massage may help older
        people relax.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>3. Cancer Treatment</h4>
    <p id="benefits">For cancer patients research reviews and clinical studies have suggested that
        at least for the short term, massage therapy may reduce pain, promote relaxation, and boost
        mood. However specific precautions with cancer patients are needed Avoid massaging: 
        open wounds, tumour site, blood clot in vein, sensitised areas post radiotherapy</p>

    <div>
        <h4>Introduction:</h4>

    <p id="benefits">An eating plan that helps manage your weight includes a variety of healthy
        foods. Add an array of colors to your plate and think of it as eating the rainbow. Dark,
        leafy greens, oranges, and tomatoes—even fresh herbs—are loaded with vitamins, fiber, and
        minerals. Adding frozen peppers, broccoli, or onions to stews and omelets gives them a
        quick and convenient boost of color and nutrients.</p>

    <br> <br>

    <h4>Five major food groups:</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Here are the following important food groups.

        <ul id="fruitlist">
        <li> vegetables and legumes or beans </li>
        <li> fruit </li>
        <li> lean meats and poultry, fish, eggs, tofu, nuts and seeds, legumes or beans </li>
        <li> grain (cereal) foods, mostly wholegrain or high cereal fibre varieties </li>
        <li> milk, yoghurt, cheese or alternatives, mostly reduced fat. </li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>

    <p id="benefits">Here are some of <span id="highlight"> tips </span> from our professional
         trainers: </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h4>Tip:1</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Prepare most of your meals at home using whole or minimally processed foods.
        Choose from a variety of different proteins to keep things interesting. Using catchy names
        for each day can help you plan.  </p>
    <br>

    <h4>Tip:2</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Make an eating plan each week – this is the key to fast, easy meal preparation.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Tip:3</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Choose recipes with plenty of vegetables and fruit.
        Your goal is to fill half your plate with vegetables and fruit at every meal.
        Choose brightly coloured fruits and vegetables each day, especially orange and dark
        green vegetables. Frozen or canned unsweetened fruits and vegetables are a perfect
        alternative to fresh produce.</p>
        <br>

    <h4>Tip:4</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Avoid sugary drinks and instead drink water. Lower-fat, unsweetened milk
        is also a good way to stay hydrated. Keep a reusable water bottle in your purse or car
        so you can fill up wherever you are going.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Tip:5</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Eat smaller meals more often. Eat at least three meals a day with snacks
        in between. When you wait too long to eat you are more likely to make unhealthy food
        choices. Keep easy-to-eat snacks in your purse or bag for emergencies.</p>

    <div>
        <h4>Introduction:</h4>

    <p id="benefits">Exercise is often only associated with losing weight, but it is more
        than just working to lose a few pounds. Exercising a few times a week can improve your
        overall health and well-being. Not all exercises give the same results because 
        certain exercises focus on different parts of the body. Exercise and physical 
        activity can be classified into four categories: endurance, strength, flexibility, 
        and balance. Each type of exercise is different; however, many activities fit into 
        more than one category. It is common for people to focus on one type of exercise or 
        activity, but including all four types of exercise into your workout will give you more
         benefits. Be sure to mix up your workouts to keep from getting bored and reduce your 
         risk of injury.
    <br> <br> </p>

    <br>

    <p id="benefits">Listed below are the four <span id="highlight" >catogories</span> 
        and examples of exercises. </p>

    <br> <br>

    <h4>1. Endurance</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Endurance, or aerobic exercise, increase your breathing and heart rate.
        By doing endurance exercises, you are working to keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory
        system healthy while improving your total fitness. Over time your endurance level will 
        increase which will make everyday activities seem easier. Examples of endurance activities 
        are: dancing, swimming, playing tennis, swift walking or jogging, biking, and yard work 
        (digging, mowing, etc.) </p>
    <br>

    <h4>2. Strength</h4>
    <p id="benefits">If you want to build up your muscles, then strength exercises are right
        for you! Strength exercises are also called “strength training” or “resistance training.”
        Even the slightest increase in strength can make a huge difference in your ability to carry
        out everyday tasks. Developing strong muscles and bones can reduce your risk of weak bones and
        slouching. Examples of strength exercises are lifting weights and using a resistance band.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>3. Flexibility</h4>
    <p id="benefits">The purpose of flexibility exercises is to stretch your muscles and help
        your body stay limber. This allows for more freedom of movement for other exercises and
        for everyday activities. Flexibility exercises also have the ability to improve your 
        range of motion, posture, ability to breathe deeply, and circulation. Also, it alleviates
        the muscle tension that is caused by stress. Examples of flexibility exercises are shoulder
        and upper arm stretches, yoga, and calf stretches.</p>
     <br>

    <h4>4. Balance</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Completing balance exercises helps prevent falls. These exercises are 
        especially important to older adults because it helps them stay independent. Most good
        balance exercises that can help maintain balance are ones that keep you constantly moving
        with your feet on the ground. Examples of balance exercises are heel-to-toe walking, 
        standing on one foot, and sitting down in a chair and standing up without using your 
        hands. Also, several lower-body strength exercises can help you improve your balance. </p>

    <h1>WEIGHT GAIN / WEIGHT LOSS</h1>

    <div id="manual_therapy">

        <figure>
            <img src="img/weight2.jpg" alt="">
    
        </figure>

    <div>
        <h4>Weight gain:</h4>

    <p id="benefits">Your doctor may put you on a weight gain program if you are underweight.
        However, this is not permission to go crazy with junk food. Healthy weight gain requires
        a balanced approach, just like a weight loss program. Eating junk food may result in weight 
        gain. However, it will not satisfy the nutrition your body needs. Even if the fat, sugar,
         and salt in junk food doesn’t result as extra weight, it can still harm your body. For a
        healthy weight gain, the following <span id="highlight">tips</span> can help:
    <br> </p>

    <h4>1. Add healthy calories</h4>
    <p id="benefits">You don’t need to drastically change your diet. You can increase calories
        by adding nut or seed toppings, cheese, and healthy side dishes. Try almonds, sunflower
        seeds, fruit, or whole-grain, wheat toast. </p>
    <br>

    <h4>2. Go nutrient dense</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Instead of eating empty calories and junk food, eat foods that are
        rich in nutrients. Consider high-protein meats, which can help you to build muscle.
        Also, choose nutritious carbohydrates, such as brown rice and other whole grains. 
        This helps ensure your body is receiving as much nourishment as possible, even if you’re
        dealing with a reduced appetite.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>3. Snack away</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Enjoy snacks that contain plenty of protein and healthy carbohydrates. 
        Consider options like trail mix, protein bars or drinks, and crackers with hummus or
        peanut butter. Also, enjoy snacks that contain “good fats,” which are important for a
        healthy heart. Examples include nuts and avocados.</p>

    <h4>4. Eat mini meals</h4>
    <p id="benefits"> If you’re struggling with a poor appetite, due to medical or emotional
        issues, eating large amounts of food may not seem appealing. Consider eating smaller
        meals throughout the day to increase your calorie intake</p>

    <h4>5. Bulk up</h4>
    <p id="benefits">While too much aerobic exercise will burn calories and work against
        your weight goal, strength training can help. This includes weightlifting or yoga.
        You gain weight by building muscle.</p>
     


   
    <h4>Weight gain:</h4>
    <p id="benefits">If your doctor recommends it, there are ways to lose weight safely. 
        A steady weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week is recommended for the most effective
        long-term weight management. That said, many eating plans leave you feeling hungry or
        unsatisfied. These are major reasons why you might find it hard to stick to a healthier
        eating plan. However, not all diets have this effect. Low carb diets and whole food,
        lower calorie diets are effective for weight loss and may be easier to stick to than
        other diets. <br>
        Here are some <span id="highlight">ways</span> to lose weight that employ healthy eating, potentially lower carbs, and that aim to:
        
        <ul id="fruitlist">
        <li>Reduce your appetite</li>
        <li>Cause fast weight loss</li>
        <li>Improve your metabolic health at the same time</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Introduction:</h4>

    <p id="benefits">Physical exercise is the performance of some activity in order to develop or
        maintain physical fitness and overall health. It is often directed toward also honing 
        athletic ability or skill. Frequent and regular physical exercise is an important 
        component in the prevention of some diseases such as heart disease, cardiovascular disease,
        Type 2 diabetes and obesity.
        <br> <br>
        Exercises are generally grouped into three types depending on the overall effect they have on 
        the human body: Flexibility exercises such as stretching improve the range of motion of muscles
        and joints; aerobic exercises such as walking and running focus on increasing cardiovascular 
        endurance; and anaerobic exercises such as weight training, functional training or sprinting 
        increase short-term muscle strength.
        <br> <br>
        Physical exercise is considered important for maintaining physical fitness including healthy
        weight; building and maintaining healthy bones, muscles, and joints; promoting physiological
        well-being; reducing surgical risks; and strengthening the immune system.
    <br> <br>

    

    <p id="benefits">Here are 6 most effective <span id="highlight"> exercises </span> described 
        along with description. 
    </p>

    <br> <br>

    <h4>1. Walking</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Any exercise program should include cardiovascular exercise, which strengthens
        the heart and burns calories. And walking is something you can do anywhere, anytime, with 
        no equipment other than a good pair of shoes. It's not just for beginners, either: 
        Even the very fit can get a good workout from walking. </p>
    <br>

    <h4>2. Interval Training</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Whether you're a beginner or an exercise veteran, a walker or an aerobic dancer,
        adding interval training to your cardiovascular workout will boost your fitness level and help
        you lose weight.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>3. Squats</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Strength training is essential, the experts say. "The more muscular fitness
        you have," says Cotton, "the greater the capacity you have to burn calories."
        And our experts tended to favor strength-training exercises that target multiple muscle groups.
        Squats, which work the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteals, are an excellent example.</p>
     
    </div>

    <h4>4. Lunges</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Like squats, lunges work all the major muscles of the lower body: gluteals,
        quadriceps, and hamstrings. A lunge is a great exercise because it mimics life, it mimics
        walking," only exaggerated, says Petersen. Lunges are a bit more advanced than squats, 
        says Cotton, helping to improve your balance as well.
        </p>

    <h4>5. Push-ups</h4>
    <p id="benefits">If done correctly, the push-up can strengthen the chest, shoulders, 
        triceps, and even the core trunk muscles, all at one time. "I'm very much into planking
        exercises, almost yoga-type moves," says Petersen. "Anytime you have the pelvis and the 
        core [abdominals and back] in a suspended position, you have to rely on your own adherent 
        strength to stabilize you.
        </p>

    <h4>6. Abdominal Crunches</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Who doesn't want firm, flat abs? Experts say that when done correctly, the 
        familiar crunch (along with its variations) is a good choice to target them. For a standard 
        crunch, says Cotton, begin lying on your back with feet flat on the floor and fingertips 
        supporting your head. Press your low back down and begin the exercise by contracting 
        abdominals and peeling first your head (tucking your chin slightly), then your neck, 
        shoulders, and upper back off the floor.

        <h4>Introduction:</h4>

    <p id="benefits">Rehabilitation is defined as “a set of interventions designed to optimize
        functioning and reduce disability in individuals with health conditions in interaction with 
        their environment”.   


    <br> <br>

    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Anybody may need rehabilitation at some point in their lives, 
        following an injury, surgery, disease or illness, or because their functioning has 
        declined with age. Some examples of rehabilitation include:</p>
    <br>

    <ul id="fruitlist">
        <li>Training in the use of a white cane, for a person with vision loss.</li>
        <li>Psychological support for a person with depression.</li>
        <li>Prescribing medicine to reduce muscle stiffness for a child with cerebral palsy.</li>
        <li>Exercise training and education on healthy living for a person with a heart disease</li>
        <li>Making, fitting and educating an individual to use a prosthesis after a leg amputation.</li>
        <li>Positioning and splinting techniques to assist with skin healing, reduce swelling, and 
            to regain movement after burn surgery.</li>

    </ul>

    <br><br>

    <h4>Benefits</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Rehabilitation can reduce the impact of a broad range of health conditions,
        including diseases (acute or chronic), illnesses or injuries. It can also complement other
        health interventions, such as medical and surgical interventions, helping to achieve the
        best outcome possible. For example, rehabilitation can help to reduce, manage or prevent 
        complications associated with many health conditions, such as spinal cord injury, stroke, 
        or a fracture. Following are the major <span id="highlight"> benefits</span> of rehabilitation
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h4>1. Improve health condition</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Rehabilitation helps to minimize or slow down the disabling effects of chronic
        health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes by equipping people
        with self-management strategies and the assistive products they require, or by addressing 
        pain or other complications. </p>
    <br>

    <h4>2. Act as an investement</h4>
    <p id="benefits">Rehabilitation is an investment, with cost benefits for both the individuals
        and society. It can help to avoid costly hospitalization, reduce hospital length of stay, 
        and prevent re-admissions. Rehabilitation also enables individuals to participate in education
        and gainful employment, remain independent at home, and minimize the need for financial or 
        caregiver support.</p>
